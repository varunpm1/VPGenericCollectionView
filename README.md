# Why?
If you're an iOS developer with couple of years of experience (like me), I can guarantee that you'll be tired with writing same set of code for initializing the collection view and it's cells. And when we plan to think of auto resizing cells (or self-sizing cells), it becomes pretty frustrating to write same/similar code in all places. This library, makes use of generics to write code once (which is already written inside this library ðŸ˜‰) and use multiple times.


# How?
VPGenericCollectionView uses a protocol based approach, to create a homogeneous collection view with auto resizing cells and handling, with very less code. VPGenericCellProtocol is a protocol defines on how the cell has to be constructed and GenericCollectionView requires cells to confirm to those protocol to work. You'll see compiler errors if you're doing something wrong and it'll inform about the error.


# Set up?
**Setting up VPGenericCollectionView**
- Declare a property of GenericCollectionView with cell class inside Generic parameters and initialize it normally. That cell should COMPULSORILY confirm to VPGenericCellProtocol.
- Set the frame / constraints normally to the parent view as we do for any other views.
- Whenever we have necessary data, call `reload:` function of GenericCollectionView instance, to update collection view.
- Optional - Modify optional parameters like cellSpacing, color, insets etc as needed.
- Optional - Set `configureCellCallback`, if cell has to be configured more other than default setup we do inside collection view cells (eg., hide or unhide buttons etc.). This will be called as soon as cellForRow is completed viewModel is initialized. The parameter inside the callback will be type casted automatically using generics.
- Optional - Set `didSelectCallback`, if cell tap selection has to be observed. The parameter inside the callback will be type casted automatically using generics.


**Setting up Collection View Cell**
- You'll be forced to define a `viewModel` property inside your cell. Declare the property with your object data type and update your views inside `didSet` of that variable which will be automatically called.


**Cons** - Doesn't support setup of VPGenericCollectionView via nib files. VPGenericCollectionView has to be created via code. But since creation is easier, I think we can ignore this.


**Note 1** - If you need a resizable collection view cells in a small expandable view, eg. Action Sheet, add the instance of VPGenericCollectionView inside a stack view and add four side constraints to Stack View and you'll be set.

**Note 2** - If you need a resizable collection view cells inside another resizable collection view cells (layer of hierarchy of VPGenericCollectionView), add it just like mentioned in **Note 1**, i.e., add a stack view inside parent cell.
